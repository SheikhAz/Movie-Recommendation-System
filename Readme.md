# 🎬 AI Chatbot and Machine Learning-Powered Movie Recommendation System.

## This project is a clever movie recommendation system that uses Streamlit, Python, and machine learning to provide users with tailored movie recommendations based on their interests. Let's dissect it so that everyone can comprehend how it operates:

# 🧠 Machine Learning for Smart Recommendations.Based on user preferences, tags, and genres, we trained a machine learning model that recognizes the connections between films.Simply pick a movie you enjoy, and the system will suggest five more that are likely to be great!

# 🛠️ Python for Data Handling
## We used powerful Python libraries like:

## Pandas for cleaning and organizing the movie data.

## NumPy, Scikit-learn, and others to build the recommendation model.

## Cleaned the dataset by removing duplicates, blank entries, and unnecessary spaces to make everything work smoothly.

# 💻 Streamlit for the User Interface
## The entire application is built using Streamlit, a Python library that allows us to create interactive and visually appealing web apps easily.

## Users get a beautiful UI with dropdown menus, movie posters, ratings, and summaries.

## A colorful and engaging layout makes it fun and easy to explore movies.

# 🤖 Natural Search AI Chatbot
## Additionally, we've included a chatbot driven by AI that can determine your mood!

## Simply type "funny college romance with a twist" or "horror movie with mystery."

## It will recognize your mood and suggest films that fit it.

## 🗣️ Bonus: Hinglish and English are supported by the chatbot!
